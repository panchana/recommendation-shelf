## Prerequisites

Most of the recommendations use user navigation as input. Therefore, it is necessary to install `biggy.pixel` to make the `recommendation-shelf` work properly. `biggy.pixel` is app used to track user navigation.

First, install the `biggy.pixel`  app:
```
vtex install biggy.pixel
```
Then go to `/admin/apps` and select the *Biggy Pixel* app. In the `apiKey` field, insert the key provided by our team.

## Usage

This app uses our store builder with the blocks architecture. To know more about Store Builder [click here.](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/understanding-storebuilder-and-stylesbuilder#structuring-and-configuring-our-store-with-object-object)

To use this app you need to import it in your dependencies on the `manifest.json`.

```json
  "dependencies": {
    "vtex.recommendation-shelf": "1.x"
  }
```

Then, you can add the `recommendation-shelf` blocks into your app theme.

Now, you can change the behavior of the shelf blocks. See the README for each component to understand how to configure it:

- [Recommendation Shelf](RecommendationShelf.md)
- [Recommendation Shelf with Refresh](RecommendationRefresh.md)
- [Recommendation Shelf Buy Together](BuyTogether.md)

### Blocks API

When implementing this app as a block, various inner blocks may be available.
The following interface lists the available blocks within `recommendation-shelf`.

```json
  "recommendation-shelf": {
    "component": "RecommendationShelf"
  },
  "recommendation-refresh": {
    "component": "RecommendationRefresh"
  },
  "recommendation-buy-together": {
    "component": "RecommendationBuyTogether"
  }
```
